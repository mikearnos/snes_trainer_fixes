These are some simple SNES trainer fixes. Most trainer options in ROMs don't work on modern SNES emulators.

It seems the trainer authors would use SRAM or RESERVED RAM to store variables. This memory area may have worked on the old backup units, but is not commonly emulated by modern SNES emulators.

```
+---------+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| $70-$77 | $0000-$7FFF | (Mode 20 SRAM) 256KBytes           | ------- |
|         | $8000-$FFFF | â€¢ RESERVED                         | ------- |
+---------+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
```

A simple fix to some trainers is to enable SRAM by changing a byte in the [internal ROM header](http://old.smwiki.net/wiki/Internal_ROM_Header).

Another fix is to change access from $70:8000 to $70:0000 by changing some code in the rom.

Also, some trainers were made for an early beta release ROM. Here I ported the code from a beta version of Alien 3 and Wildguns to the final ROM version.

Below are the source files to be patched, they are not included. I used [xkas v0.06](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/269/) as the assembler.
